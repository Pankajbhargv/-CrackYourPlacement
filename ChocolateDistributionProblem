//Chocolate Distribution Problem
This is a very tricky problem and here I have learnt a new concept.

Algorithm:
First sort the array;
Then take subarray of size m(no of students);
find the difference between the last and first element of the subarray;
Return the minimum differnce;

Code:
Class Solution{
public:
int ChocolateDis(vector<int> &v){
sort(v.begin(),v.end());
int min_diff=INT_MAX;
//after sorting the array start a for loop and find the differnece between last and first element of the subarrray;
for(int i=0;i+m-1<v.size();i++){
int diff=a[i+m-1]-a[i];
if(diff<min_diff){
min_diff=diff;
}
}
return min_diff;
}
}
