//Remove Duplicate from sorted array
This question was quite tricky but the logic was simple
In this question we have used two pointer.

Algorithm;
First start the for loop from 1
Then start a variable i.e. id=1;
so that when the two elements are different then the element can be copied in the nums[id];

Code is given below:
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& v) {
        int n=v.size(); //size of array
        int id=1; //pointer pointing to second element of the array
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
        //we are checking that the current and previous elements are equal or not. If not equal then copy the element in nums[id]
            if(v[i]!=v[i-1]){
                v[id++]=v[i];
            }
        }
        return id;
    }
};
